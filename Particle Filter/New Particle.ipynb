    "sample impoverishment. We can see why your approach suffers from it with a fairly simple example. Let's say you have 3 particles and their normalized weights are 0.1, 0.1, 0.8. Then multiplying by each weight by the 3 yields 0.3, 0.3, and 2.4. Then rounding yields 0, 0, 2. This means you would not pick the first two particles and the last one would be picked twice. Now you are down to two particles. I suspect this is what you have been seeing when you say \"due to the roundoff errors, I end up having less particles.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative selection method would be as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Normalize weights.\n",
    "    Calculate an array of the cumulative sum of the weights.\n",
    "    Randomly generate a number & determine which range in that cumulative weight array to which the number belongs.\n",
    "    The index of that range would correspond to the particle that should be created.\n",
    "    Repeat until you have the desired number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, using the example above we would start with the normalized weights. We would then calculate the array [0.1, 0.2, 1]. From there we calculate 3 random numbers say 0.15, 0.38, and 0.54. This would have us pick the second particle once and the third particle twice. The point is that it gives the smaller particles a chance to propagate.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that while this method will deal with impoverishment it can lead to a suboptimal solutions. For instance, it may be that none of the particles really match your given location well (assuming you're using this for localization). The weights only tell you which particles match best, not the quality of the match. As such when you take additional readings and repeat the process you may find that all your particles group at a single location that is not the correct location. This is usually because there were no good particles to start. "
